            <p>I am currently a college student at the University of Baguio, 
                completing my first semester as a BS Computer Science major. 
                As an aspiring software developer, I’m passionate about learning 
                how technology shapes the world and how I can contribute to it. 
                I’m continuously building my skills in programming, problem-solving, 
                and software development as I work toward becoming a professional in the 
                field.

                <p>Throughout the first semester HUMCOM has always been one of my favorite subjects by far, It was simple, informative, and easy to follow. 
                    This subject is one of the most fun and engaging subjects for my first semester, Learning HTML again was quite fun since it is so simple and 
                    it challenged me to improve further. Every single success made it feel quite fulfilling knowing that my code somehow worked and it also gave me 
                    new knowledge which I could apply to my future projects. I really appreciated how clearly the lessons were presented, making it effortless to keep up and build confidence with each new concept introduced.</p>

                <p>I really enjoyed revisiting HTML. Even with past experience, it was fun because it's so straightforward, making it the perfect starting point. 
                    Instead of being boring, that familiarity motivated me to improve, focusing on writing cleaner, better code. Seeing my code successfully create a working page was incredibly fulfilling and a huge boost. 
                    It was awesome to see my effort result in something tangible!</p>

                <p>The best part of HUMCOM was definitely gaining new knowledge and the fact that some lessons were turned into games which made learning exciting and fun. Each successful bit of code meant I learned something I could instantly use. 
                    These are skills that feel truly valuable for my future projects, both in school and my career. The subject transformed a potentially dry technical lesson into something engaging. 
                    I finished the semester feeling ready and excited to use HTML and all the concepts I learned to use them in the future.</p>
